# Development is resumed.

Great news! Development is resumed.
I made an (i think) working multiloader workspace. Meaning, its more than likely that this mod
will be compatible with NeoForge in the near future and with Fabric sometime after that.

Due to my familiarity with Forge, all the new features will be implemented in Forge first.
When I feel like I have a base of features to port, the NeoForge version will be released.
As for Fabric, the intention is there but It might take a while
